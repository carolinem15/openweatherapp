## Description

This weather dashboard is designed to provide a weather report for any city that a user searches using the OpenWeather API. The results display temperature, an icon indicating the weather, humidity, and wind speed.  The purpose of this application is to practice AJAX calls to APIs and have the responses rendered into the browser using jQuery. In the future, I would like this application to also enable you to save previously searched locations, favorite frequented cities, and provide a radar tab using a different API. 

When first building this app, I ran into issues making one of my AJAX calls, so I used fetch instead. I also ran into a weird bug that resulted in thousands of calls to the API per second. I also kept getting a no-CORS error. 

## Installation

To install this project, navigate to the URL provided. 

## Usage

The main homepage will contain a field to enter the city you would like to search. Hit "submit" and the results will render onto the right side of the page.
